	<h1>Cool Mom Debby!</h1>

	<p>As the token cool mom of the block, Debby always has the best snacks, tells the best jokes, and is so relatable. 
		<br>
	She loves going out with her girlfriends and keeping up with the latest trends. Because of this, her house is the 
<br> 
ultimate hang-out spot. Her kid’s friends don’t know if they want to be her child or want to be, well, Debby! 
<br>
Debby's kids get embarrassed when she's mistaken for their sibling, but hey, what can she say? 
She is the cool mom, after all! </p>
	<h1>Soccer Mom Pam!</h1>

	<p>As the neighborhood’s soccer mom, Pam makes motherhood look like a piece of cake. 
		<br>
	At a sharp 4:35am, she's up and running. She's president of the PTA, assistant coach for 
	<br>
	the pee-wee soccer team, 
	and three-time first place prize winner at the elementary school’s 
<br>
	annual bake sale. 
	Yet, she still manages to 
	throw one hell of a Birthday Party and smother 
	<br>
	her kids with hugs and kisses full-time. She looks like she's has it all together 
	<br>
	and she pulls that look off with grace and confidence.

<h1>Casserole Mom Dawn!</h1>

	<p>As a Casserole mom Dawn has this way about her that cannot be learned. 
	<br>
	She's bubbly, she thrives socially, and loves to cook. 
	She has friends everywhere 
	<br>
	constantly inviting her to their barbecues, but she prefers to host at her house (any 
	<br>
	excuse to get into her secret stash of family recipes that only she has access to). 
	<br>
	Dawn is also one busy lady. She's involved in a variety of activities, 
	but her 
	<br>
	favorite activity is spending time with her children and shoving food down their 
	<br>
	throats. Dawn does photography on the side and thoroughly enjoys decorating her house 
	<br>
	in accordance to her “Home Decor” Pinterest board. 
	<br>
	And, finally, she makes one KILLER Casserole.
