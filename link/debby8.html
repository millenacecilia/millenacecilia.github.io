	<p>As the token cool mom of the block, you always have the best snacks, you tell the best jokes, and you’re so relatable. 
		<br>
	You love going out with your girlfriends and keeping up with the latest trends. Because of this, your house is the 
<br> 
ultimate hang-out spot. Your kid’s friends don’t know if they want to be your child or want to be, well, you! 
<br>
Your kids get embarrassed when you’re mistaken for their sibling, but hey, what can you say? 
You are the cool mom, after all! </p>
