	<h1>You Got: Dance Mom Gina!</h1>
	<img src="gina.gif">
	<p>As a classic Dance Mom, you have a proficient skill set in applying makeup, 
		<br>
		executing quick wardrobe changes in between numbers, 
		and sewing dance costumes. 
		<br>
		Aside from your duties, you do pilates every Wednesday Morning and Brunch every
		<br>
		Sunday Afternoon with the other mom’s from the studio. Not to mention, you're always 
		<br>
		down for 
		a girl's wine night in. You’re very competitive and, although some might 
		<br>
		view you as intense, 
		you only want your child to succeed. 
		You take your child’s friends in 
		<br>as your own and you’re 
		quick to protect everyone and anyone you care about. 
		<br>
		Go, Gina!
