	<ul>
		<h3><li><a href="debby3.html">Refined and sophisticated. I'm practically a brand ambassador for Banana Republic.</a></li></h3>
		<h3><li><a href="pam3.html">Comfortably Athletic. Leggings, running shoes, baseball hats--you name it. Between Kayleigh's swimming lessons and Tucker's football practice, I'm always on the go.</a></li></h3>
		<h3><li><a href="dawn3.html">Versatile, but make it fashion. Jeans and ankle boots are my go-tos. How could they not be?</a></li></h3>
		<h3><li><a href="gina3.html">Casual. I throw on a pair of black capris with a T-shirt and I'm ready to start the day. Who has time for that stuff anyway?</a></li></h3>
