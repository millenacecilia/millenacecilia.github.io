	<ul>
		<h3><a href="debby3.html"><li>Refined and sophisticated. I'm practically a brand ambassador for Banana Republic.</li></a></h3>
		<h3><a href="pam3.html"><li>Comfortably Athletic. Leggings, running shoes, baseball hats--you name it. Between Kayleigh's swimming lessons and Tucker's football practice, I'm always on the go.</a></li></h3>
		<h3><a href="dawn3.html"><li>Versatile, but make it fashion. Jeans and ankle boots are my go-tos. How could they not be?</li></a></h3>
		<h3><a href="gina3.html"><li>Casual. I throw on a pair of black capris with a T-shirt and I'm ready to start the day. Who has time for that stuff anyway?</li></a></h3>
