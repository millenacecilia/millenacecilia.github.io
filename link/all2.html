	<h1>Cool Mom Debby!</h1>

	<p>As the token cool mom of the block, Debby always has the best snacks, tells the best jokes, and is so relatable. 
		<br>
	She loves going out with her girlfriends and keeping up with the latest trends. Because of this, her house is the 
<br> 
ultimate hang-out spot. Her kid’s friends don’t know if they want to be her child or want to be, well, Debby! 
<br>
Debby's kids get embarrassed when she's mistaken for their sibling, but hey, what can she say? 
She is the cool mom, after all! </p>
<h1>Casserole Mom Dawn!</h1>

	<p>As a Casserole mom Dawn has this way about her that cannot be learned. 
	<br>
	She's bubbly, she thrives socially, and loves to cook. 
	She has friends everywhere 
	<br>
	constantly inviting her to their barbecues, but she prefers to host at her house (any 
	<br>
	excuse to get into her secret stash of family recipes that only she has access to).
	<br>
	Dawn is also one busy lady. She's involved in a variety of activities, 
	but her 
	<br>
	favorite activity is spending time with her children and shoving food down their 
	<br>
	throats. Dawn does photography on the side and thoroughly enjoys decorating her house 
	<br>
	in accordance to her “Home Decor” Pinterest board. 
	<br>
	And, finally, she makes one KILLER Casserole.

<h1>Dance Mom Gina!</h1>

	<p>As a classic Dance Mom, Gina has a proficient skill-set in applying makeup, 
		<br>
		executing quick wardrobe changes in between numbers, 
		and sewing dance costumes. 
		<br>
		Aside from her duties, Gina does pilates every Wednesday Morning and Brunch every
		<br>
		Sunday Afternoon with the other mom’s from the studio. Not to mention, she's always 
		<br>
		down for 
		a girl's wine night in. Gina's very competitive and, although some might 
		<br>
		view her as intense, 
		she only wants her child to succeed. 
		Gina takes her child’s friends in 
		<br>as her own and she's 
		quick to protect everyone and anyone she cares about. 
		<br>
		Go, Gina!
