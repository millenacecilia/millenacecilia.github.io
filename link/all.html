	<h1>Soccer Mom Pam!</h1>
	<img src="pam.gif">
	<p>As the neighborhood’s soccer mom, Pam makes motherhood look like a piece of cake. 
		<br>
	At a sharp 4:35am, she's up and running. She's president of the PTA, assistant coach for 
	<br>
	the pee-wee soccer team, 
	and three-time first place prize winner at the elementary school’s 
<br>
	annual bake sale. 
	Yet, she still manages to 
	throw one hell of a Birthday Party and smother 
	<br>
	her kids with hugs and kisses full-time. She looks like she's has it all together 
	<br>
	and she pulls that look off with grace and confidence.

<h1>Casserole Mom Dawn!</h1>

	<p>As a Casserole mom Dawn has this way about you that cannot be learned. 
	<br>
	She's bubbly, she thrives socially, and loves to cook. 
	She has friends everywhere 
	<br>
	constantly inviting her to their barbecues, but she prefers to host at her house—any 
	<br>
	excuse to get into her secret stash of family recipes that only she has access to. 
	<br>
	Dawn is also one busy lady. She's involved in a variety of activities, 
	but her 
	<br>
	favorite activity is spending time with her children and shoving food down their 
	<br>
	throats. Dawn does photography on the side and thoroughly enjoys decorating her house 
	<br>
	in accordance to her “Home Decor” Pinterest board. 
	<br>
	And, finally, she makes one KILLER Casserole.

<h1>Dance Mom Gina!</h1>
	<img src="gina.gif">
	<p>As a classic Dance Mom, Gina has a proficient skill set in applying makeup, 
		<br>
		executing quick wardrobe changes in between numbers, 
		and sewing dance costumes. 
		<br>
		Aside from her duties, Gina does pilates every Wednesday Morning and Brunch every
		<br>
		Sunday Afternoon with the other mom’s from the studio. Not to mention, she's always 
		<br>
		down for 
		a girl's wine night in. Gina's very competitive and, although some might 
		<br>
		view her as intense, 
		she only wants her child to succeed. 
		Gina takes her child’s friends in 
		<br>as her own and she's 
		quick to protect everyone and anyone she cares about. 
		<br>
		Go, Gina!
