  <p> Wake Up and Smell the Coffee is the fifth studio album by Irish alternative rock[5] band The Cranberries, and their last before their six-year hiatus. Released on 22 October 2001, the album sold 170,000 copies in the US by April 2007. Worldwide, the album sold 1,300,000 copies by 2002.
  <br>
  This marks the band's only album on MCA Records. They were transferred to MCA after the merger of PolyGram (which owned their previous label, Island Records) with MCA's parent Universal Music Group in 1999. The album was never released on vinyl.</p>
