  <p> Black Holes and Revelations is the fourth studio album by English rock band Muse. It was released on 3 July 2006 through the band's own Helium-3 imprint as well as Warner Bros. Records. Recording was done in a four-month span and was split between New York and France. It also marked the first time the band took a more active role in production. Black Holes and Revelations saw a change in style from Muse's previous albums, and the band cited influences that included Depeche Mode, Millionaire, Lightning Bolt, Sly and the Family Stone, and music from southern Italy.[4] Like their two previous albums, it features political and dystopian undertones, with lyrics covering topics such as political corruption, alien invasion, revolution, and New World Order conspiracies, as well as more conventional love songs.

  Black Holes and Revelations was both a critical and commercial success. It received positive reviews from critics and appeared on many year-end lists. It received a Mercury Prize nomination and later appeared in the 2007 version of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album entered the charts at number one in five countries, including the United Kingdom, and within the top 10 in several other countries. It was later certified triple-platinum by the BPI for selling at least 900,000 copies in the UK and platinum by the RIAA for selling at least one million copies in the United States. The album also spawned five successful singles. "Supermassive Black Hole" and "Knights of Cydonia" were both UK top-10 hits, while "Starlight", "Map of the Problematique", and "Invincible" all charted within the top-25.</p>
